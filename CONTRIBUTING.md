## 🛠 Development Setup

The project is built with Swift Package Manager (SPM).

### Prerequisites
- macOS 26.0 (Tahoe) or later.
- Xcode 15 or later.
- Swift 6.2.3.
- [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) installed.

### Run from Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryzenixx/valetbar-macos.git
   cd valetbar-macos
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   Double-click `Package.swift` or run:
   ```bash
   open Package.swift
   ```

3. **Build & Run**
   Select the `ValetBar` target and press `Cmd+R`.

> **Important Note on Dev Mode**:
> When running locally via Xcode (`DEBUG` configuration), the app runs in **Developer Mode**.
> - **Visuals**: The interface is slightly darker/matte. This is normal behavior for inactive windows in debug mode.
> - **Updates**: The internal `UpdaterController` is disabled to prevent Sparkle errors.
> - **Assets**: Icons load from the local `Bundle.module` provided by SPM.

### Coding Standards

- Use **Swift 6** modern concurrency features (`async`/`await`) where possible.
- Layouts should be built with **SwiftUI**.
- Ensure `MenuBarView.swift` remains the clean, declarative entry point for the UI.
- Keep the "Native macOS Feel" in mind. Use system fonts, materials (`NSVisualEffectView`), and standard controls.
